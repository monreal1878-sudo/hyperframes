description: Organic physics (a rope, flag, cloth, debris, a flock) never runs at render time — a build script steps the simulation at dt = 1 / fps with a seeded PRNG and writes per-frame data; playback is one `ease:"none"` driver whose onUpdate does `frames[Math.round(t × fps)]`, an index lookup and nothing else. Seek-safe and deterministic by construction; shipped as a synchronous script include, never fetched.

# Baked Sim

A hanging pennant catching wind, a rope settling, a cloud of debris tumbling: motion that comes from a **simulation** — integration, constraints, forces — not from an ease. A simulation is stateful by nature (frame N depends on frame N−1), which is exactly what a seeked renderer cannot run. So the simulation runs **once, offline**, at build time, and the composition replays its output by frame index. The renderer sees a lookup, never an integrator.

Boundaries: [particle-burst.md](particle-burst.md) needs no bake — each particle is a closed-form ballistic function of time and evaluates directly. Bake when the bodies **interact** (constraints, collisions, wind on a chain, flocking) or the step is iterative. A [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) idle is neither; keep it analytic.

## How It Works

1. **Bake** — a build script (`bake/bake-<name>.mjs`) steps the sim at `dt = 1 / FPS` for `PRE_ROLL + FRAMES` steps with a seeded PRNG (`mulberry32(SEED)`, never `Math.random`), fixed iteration counts, and per-frame forces computed from the frame number. It writes one entry per composition frame: an SVG path `d`, an array of transforms, a list of points.
2. **Ship synchronously** — the output is a script that assigns one global (`window.__PENNANT = {...}`), loaded with a plain `<script src>` before the composition script. Never `fetch()`: an async load races the renderer's first-frame capture, and a seek to t=0 can land on empty data.
3. **Replay** — one `ease: "none"` proxy tween spans the clip; its `onUpdate` computes `i = clamp(Math.round(proxy.f))` and applies `frames[i]`. No integration, no accumulated state, no RNG at runtime — a seek to any frame reads the same entry every time.
4. **Pre-roll** — the bake runs `PRE_ROLL` steps (≈ 60 frames) before frame 0 and discards them, so the system is already hanging or settled at the first captured frame instead of falling into place.

  };
}

const frames = [];
for (let f = -PRE_ROLL; f < FRAMES; f++) {
  const wind = windAt(Math.max(0, f));

      const a = pts[i],
        b = pts[i + 1],
        dx = b.x - a.x,
        dy = b.y - a.y;
      const d = Math.hypot(dx, dy) || 1e-6,
        diff = (d - SEG) / d,

      a.y += dy * diff * wa;
      b.x -= dx * diff * wb;
      b.y -= dy * diff * wb;
    }
  }
  if (f >= 0) frames.push(toPathD(pts));
}
function toPathD(pts) {
  // a smooth quadratic through the segment midpoints: "M x0 y0 Q x1 y1 mx my … L xN yN"

## Variations

- **Transform arrays** — bake `[x, y, rot]` per body per frame (debris, a flock) and write each element's `transform` in the same `onUpdate`; the pool is fixed at setup.
- **Canvas draw** — bake point lists and draw them with `ctx` inside the driver: the canvas becomes a pure function of the frame index (paint frame 0 at setup).
- **Two-rate bake** — simulate at a finer `dt` (`1 / (FPS × 2)`) for stiff constraints and write every second step; the composition still indexes at its own fps.
- **Re-bake for direction** — a physically correct sim is not yet art-directed: the reference pennant hung limp until wind ≈ 3 × gravity, and streams at that ratio. Budget one bake iteration for the look, then freeze the seed.
- **Designed motion on top** — the baked object still takes ordinary tweens (a fade-in, a settle, an exit); the bake owns only what the sim owns. One owner per property: when the driver writes an element's `transform`, put the designed transform tween on a wrapper, so neither write clobbers the other.

## Values

| token     | range                          | notes                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FPS       | = the composition's `data-fps` | one entry per composition frame; the driver's `round()` then never straddles two     |
| PRE_ROLL  | 30–90 frames (default 60)      | enough for the system to hang / settle before frame 0                                |
| ITER      | 8–20 constraint passes         | stiffness; more = stiffer rope, longer bake, same file size                          |
| SEED      | any fixed integer              | change it to change the gusts; commit it with the data                               |
| data size | ≲ 100–300 KB per baked object  | a 210-frame, 16-point path is ~75 KB; past ~1 MB decimate the path or the body count |

## Critical Constraints

- **No integration at runtime** — the composition never steps, accumulates, or reads a previous frame; `frames[i]` is the whole runtime. A per-frame `+=` on baked state re-introduces the race the bake removed.
- **Synchronous include** — the baked script is a `<script src>` that runs before the composition script; never `fetch()` / dynamic `import()` at runtime.
- **Seeded and pinned** — a seeded PRNG in the bake, fixed `dt`, fixed iteration counts; no `Math.random`, no wall-clock, no host-dependent step. Re-running the bake reproduces the file byte for byte.
- **Frame 0 is structural** — call the apply function once at setup; a tween evaluated exactly at its start edge may not fire `onUpdate` on the first seek.
- **To change the motion, re-bake** — never a runtime knob that alters replayed data.
- The bake script and its inputs ship beside the composition (`bake/`) so the data has provenance; the data file is what renders.
